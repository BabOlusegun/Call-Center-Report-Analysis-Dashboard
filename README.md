# Call Center Report Analysis Dashboard

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of a call center over a full operational year (2023). Using Microsoft Excel, I developed a dynamic and user friendly dashboard that captures critical metrics such as call volume, revenue, call duration, agent performance, customer satisfaction, and caller demographics. The goal of this project was to provide management with a clear and interactive view of call center efficiency, helping them make informed decisions about staffing, training, and resource allocation.
